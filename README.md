We are monitoring the health related activities using data collected 
from android app called AndroSensor.

We collected the data using mobile for different activities such as, 

      1. Number of stairs taken.
      2. Number of Squats.
      3. Resting during activity.
      4. Calories burn during activities.
      5. Noise detection.
      6. Blue light detection.
      7. Number of jumps.
      8. Phone distraction during activities. 
      
We are extracting features and visualizing it using python libraries
like pandas, matplotlib and numpy.
